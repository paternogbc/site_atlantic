# BEF-Atlantic Experiment

**BEF-Atlantic** project is a large-scale restoration project and tree diversity experiment in the brazilian Atlantic Forest, designed to test the effect of tree richness and phylogenetic diversity on ecosystem functioning and restoration success of degraded tropical forests. 

The main aim of **BEF-Atlantic** is to understand how tree diversity influences: 
* **(i)** the colonization of multiple taxonomic groups
* **(ii)** the interaction networks and multitrophic interactions  
* **(iii)** the ecosystem processes and multifunctionality  
* **(iv)** the feedback between plant-soil, soil-atmosphere and terrestrial-aquatic systems. 

Ultimately this project aims to **provide clear guidelines for effective ecological restoration** of the biodiversity and functioning of degraded Atlantic forest areas. 

The project will be implemented in October 2021 on a degraded area dominated by abandoned pasture at the Fazenda Experimental do Núcleo de Integração Acadêmica para a Sustentabilidade Socioambiental da Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (NIASSA-UFJF).

# Experimental area

The BEF-Atlantic experiment will restore a large area of abandoned pasture in the Atlantic Forest of Minas Gerais Brasil.

# Local seedlings 

Seedlings of native tree species from the area are being produced in the local seedling nursery.
