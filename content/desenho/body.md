# BEF-Atlantic Experiment

**BEF-Atlantic** project is a large-scale restoration project and tree diversity experiment in the brazilian Atlantic Forest, designed to test the effect of tree richness and phylogenetic diversity on ecosystem functioning and restoration success of degraded tropical forests. 

The main aim of **BEF-Atlantic** is to understand how tree diversity influences (i) the colonization of multiple taxonomic groups, (ii) the interaction networks and multitrophic interactions, (iii) the ecosystem processes and multifunctionality, and (iv) the feedback between plant-soil, soil-atmosphere and terrestrial-aquatic systems. Ultimately this project aims to provide clear guidelines for effective ecological restoration of the biodiversity and functioning of degraded Mata Atlantic areas. 

The project will be implemented in October 2021 on a degraded area dominated by abandoned pasture at the Fazenda Experimental do Núcleo de Integração Acadêmica para a Sustentabilidade Socioambiental da Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (NIASSA-UFJF).

# Plot Design

**BEF-Atlantic** consists of 232 experimental plots (21.25 x 26 m) with contrasting tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity, totalizing an area of 13 hectares and the planting of 22,000 trees. The overall pool of species will be 48 natives tree species from the Atlantic Forest. 

Each experimental plot will contain 96 trees and will be divided in 4 equal subplots. Trees will be planted in a hexagonal planting pattern with distancing 2.3 meters from each other.

# Richness gradients and compositions

**The experiment** will implement two orthogonal gradients by manipulating (i) species richness and (ii) phylogenetic diversity across compositions with the same richness level. 

Tree species richness will vary from 0 (control species), 1 (monocultures), 3, 6, 12 and 24 tree species. For treatments with 3, 6 and 12 species, compositions with contrasting mean pairwise phylogenetic distances will be selected to maximize the phylogenetic gradient. 

Overall the experiment will contain 54 unique compositions replicated at least 4 times each, and distributed as follows:

* **Monocultures**: 24 compositions     
* **3-species**: 16 compositions (varying in phylogenetic distance)  
* **6-species**: 8 compositions (varying in phylogenetic distance)  
* **12-species**: 4 compositions (varying in phylogenetic distance)  
* **24-species**: 1 compositions  

Compositions will be defined following a **random partition design** to ensure that each species is equally represented across random extinction scenarios. 

In addition a high-diversity treatment with 48 tree species will be also implemented as reference.
